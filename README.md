# Decentralized-Crypto-Exchange

In this project I implemented a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange in Solidity. This exchange has much of the functionality possessed by full fledged decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap. Additionally, I created my own ERC20 token, tradable over the implemented exchange.
